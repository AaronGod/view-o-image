        Where to Put Suitcase and Luggage on Chinese Train
        After you get on the train, you can put your suitcase or large handbag under the seat or in the overhead
        compartment, whether you are in a seat class or sleeper carriage. For high speed train travelers, there are
        extra spaces for large luggage at the coupled coaches and behind the last row. Small bags, valuable personal
        stuff are high suggested to be carried around with you.

        Normal Trains – Luggage Space on K, T, Z Trains
        There are two different compartments on normal trains: seat class carriage and sleeper carriage. The most crowed
        and competitive situation occurs in the seat class car, probably a huge challenge to snag vacancy for your hand
        luggage, while the sleeper car has more private spaces. Read our guide carefully, anyhow you can manage to find
        a luggage area.

        Seat Class Carriage

        If you buy a seat class ticket, you can firstly put luggage under your seat where is always easy to notice, if
        there is still enough room. Otherwise, you need to lift the suitcase or bags and stow it in the overhead luggage
        rack, which is set at both sides in every coach. Besides, you can place bottled waters, snacks on the middle
        small board in front or your seat.

        Usually, a 24 inch suitcase is suitable to be placed under the seat and a 28 inch suitcase is the maximum size
        on the luggage travel, maybe some part will protrude outside the shelf. Considering the travel convenience, you
        are suggested to travel light, and a 24 inches suitcase is better enough and the most appropriate choice.

        Hard Sleeper Class Carriage

        If you take a hard sleeper berth, you can either put your luggage in the overhead rack above the aisle or tuck
        them under the lower berth. Please notice that the space underneath the lower bunk (about 31.5cm high) is just
        suitable for flatly placed small suitcase or bag, a 24 inch luggage case would fit the best. If your suitcase is
        larger than that size, you can put it to specialized parcel shelf opposite your berth or place it upright on the
        floor between the two lower berths. Small bags can be hung on the wall pothook in each berth.

        Soft Sleeper Class Carriage

        Soft sleeper car is a relatively private compartment shared by four passengers. You mainly have three places to
        arrange your luggage. One is the special luggage area over the entrance door (near the upper berth), where is
        quite enough for a lying child (about 40cm high), and a 28 inch cases would be ok. The second luggage area is
        the two spaces under the lower berths (about 30cm high), where can put 28 inch suitcase at most. The last option
        is to place the huge box or bag on the floor under the public small table or between the lower berths, in this
        way any size is accepted.

        Consign Your Luggage – Express Service
        Passengers going to take luggage in super large size or inconvenient to carry may choose the baggage and parcel
        transportation service by railway if the departure and destination stations both have baggage service. Normal
        train passenger is limited to check baggage one time only with a valid ticket, while the disabled ticket owner
        can make the consignment many times.

        Important Tips for Rail Luggage Consignment
        1. Suitcase, trolley bag, and handbag and so on personal luggage should be tightly and completely packed for
        railway transportation.
        2. The total weight shall no exceed 50 kg/110 Ib. If not, the extra part will be paid with a large surcharge.
        3. Senders must write down the detailed information clearly and accurately, including the name, address of the
        sender and receiver.
        4. The checked luggage is charged according to fixed unit price and exact weight.
        5. Senders can collect the baggage and parcel with check receipt once receive the notice. The baggage will be
        kept without charge for only 3 days.

        Passengers can NOT check baggage on high speed train, because they don’t have specialized baggage cars for
        shipping. If you are required by the train staff that your luggage exceeds the allowance and should be
        consigned, you need to apply for consignment at the baggage office at the departure station. It follows that
        your luggage will arrive later than your train for the separate delivery on another different railroad. You can
        contact us to get more details about railway luggage shipping service.

        Red-cap Porter at Train Station
        Porter service is available outside and inside the major train stations. People wearing red hats and jackets are
        so called Red-cap Porters who offers paid carrying service. The Red-cap team can use trolleys to help you carry
        large luggage to your carriage or take it to the arrival.

        Generally, they will charge ￥10~￥30 per piece in different cities. If it’s really a tough work to handle your
        luggage by yourself, we think you should take advantage of the porter service to board lightly and quickly.
        Meanwhile, some red-cap porters are volunteers, giving free counseling, translation, guide and convenient
        assistance for passengers.

        Luggage Storage at Train Station - Left Luggage Service
        Almost all major train stations in China have luggage storage service. To deposit your luggage, official baggage
        office is the most reliable choice. Beijing, Shanghai and China’s main cities still provide Left Luggage
        facilities - automatic lockers at the train station. Apart from that, you can store luggage in some private
        shops, restaurants nearby. The costs depend on the size, amount and duration of your left luggage. The left
        luggage room usually keeps the luggage only by the end of day, so if you want to leave them for a long time,
        check carefully with the worker.

        Tips for Carry China Train Baggage
        ● There is NO luggage trolleys available at train stations, but you can pay for porter service if necessary.
        ● You probably have to go through stairs with your luggage to get on the train, for some train stations don’t
        have elevators to take. Also, there is always Red-cap Porter you ask help for.
        ● Take care of your personal staff and all valuable items, because the stations will be very crowed at the
        ticket entrance, especially during high seasons.
        ● Label your luggage to make it recognize easily if your baggage are out of sight.
        ● Better not place supersize and heavy luggage on the shelf, because it would be difficult to lift up and take
        down from the shelf, even faces risk of falling down on passengers.
        ● Don’t put your luggage somewhere it may cause inconvenience, such as bock the door or in the aisle passengers
        and train staff would pass by.
        ● Leave enough time to get and check your baggage before disembark.
